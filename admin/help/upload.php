Scroll down and hopefully you'll see a box headed 'gd', if not the gd module is not enabled. Contact your host for more details. <br />The gd library is availble from <a href=\"http://www.boutell.com/gd\">http://boutell.com/gd</a>.<br /><br />Any problems will be met by an error message - if you get a permission denied error you need to chmod certain directories on your server - see the readme.txt file for details. If an image isn't resizing and you have gd installed try using a different file type (ie try .jpg instead of .gif).";
