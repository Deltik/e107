<div class="mediumtext">Requirements</div>
e107 will only work with version 4.1 or newer of PHP. If you need to upgrade see <a href="http://php.net">http://php.net</a> for details. If you are remote hosted contact your site administrator.
<br /><hr /><br />
<div class="mediumtext">Installation Instructions</div>
Fresh Install ---
<ul>
<li>If you wish e107 to use it's own database, create one using phpMyAdmin - you can call the database anything you wish.</li>
<li>Upload all the files to your server, leaving the file structure intact.</li>
<li>In your ftp client, change the file permissions of /config.php to 666 (CHMOD 666)</li>
<li>Open your browser and navigate to install.php (ie http://yourURL/install.php).  Follow the instructions to install e107. If there are any problems you will be informed.</li>
</ul>
During the install process you will be asked to set up the main site admin, please write the details you enter down as for security purposes they cannot be retrieved later.
<br /><br />


Upgrading your version/build ---
<ul>
<li><b>Backup your config.php file</b></li>
<li>Upload all files to your server EXCEPT config.php - don't overwrite this file</li>
<li>Navigate to upgrade.php in your browser and follow the instructions</li>
</ul>


For security reasons you should chmod your config.php file back to 644 after installation is complete.<br />
<br />
You also need to chmod the two files (news.xml and news.txt) in the /backend directory to 666 for your xml generation to work properly.


<br /><hr /><br />

<div class="mediumtext">Common problems</div>
Most problems are related to not having a recent enough version of PHP installed on the server. If you keep returning to the same stage during install you are probably running a version of PHP older than 4.1.<br />
You need cookies enabled in your browser to log in.<br />
Your logo is situated at /themes/shared/logo.png, change this file to alter your logo
<br /><hr /><br />
