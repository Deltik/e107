<br /><hr /><br />

<div class="mediumtext">Requirements</div>
e107 will only work with version 4.1.0 or newer of PHP. If you need to upgrade see <a href="http://php.net">http://php.net</a> for details. If you are remote hosted contact your site administrator.<br />
<br /><hr /><br />
<div class="mediumtext">Installation Instructions</div>
Fresh Install ---
<ul>
<li>e107 needs a mysql database to store all your site content, you can either create one manually, or the install script will create one for you if you have the correct permissions. e107 can also share a database with other scripts if you so wish (use a table prefix to avoid conflicts).
<li>Upload all the files to your server, leaving the file structure intact.</li>
<li>In your FTP client, change the file permissions of the following files ...<br />
<b>e107_config.php</b> : 777<br />
<b>e107_files/backend/news.xml</b> : 777<br />
<b>e107_files/backend/news.txt</b> : 777<br />
<b>e107_files/public/</b> : 777<br />
<b>e107_files/public/avatars</b> : 777<br />
<li>Open your browser and navigate to install.php (ie http://<i>yourURL.com</i>/install.php).  Follow the instructions to install e107. If there are any problems you will be informed.</li>
</ul>
During the install process you will be asked to set up the main site admin, please write the details you enter down as for security purposes they cannot be retrieved later.
<br /><br />


Upgrading your version/build ---
<ul>
<li><b>Backup your e107_config.php file</b></li>
<li>Upload all files to your server EXCEPT e107_config.php - don't overwrite this file</li>
<li>If upgrade.php exists navigate to it in your browser and follow the instructions</li>
</ul>


<div class="installe">For security reasons you should chmod your e107_config.php file back to 644 after installation is complete, and delete install.php from your server.</div>
<br />
<br /><hr /><br />

<div class="mediumtext">Common problems</div>
<b>If for any reason your site becomes totally unreachable due to fatal errors etc, try running /e107_files/resetcore.php in your browser, this will restore the default core values back into the database - none of your content will be altered by running this script.</b><br />
You need cookies enabled in your browser to log in.<br />
e107 was developed under WindowsXP/Apache2/PHP 4.3.1-dev/mySQL 3.23.54-nt, and Unix/Apache1.3.27/PHP 4.2.3/mySQL 3.23.54. It has also been thoroughly tested under a IIS server environment. If you use a different setup and are experiencing problems please contact me.<br />
If you are having trouble setting e107 up on a free host then it's probably because your generous host has disabled too many features for e107 to work. Free hosts are free for a reason.<br />
<br /><hr /><br />

<div class="mediumtext">Support</div>
<b>e107 forums</b> <a href='http://e107.org/forum.php'>http://e107.org/forum.php</a><br />
<b>IRC channel</b> #e107 on irc.freenode.net<br />
